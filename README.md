ADA fruit manufactures LED panels which can be used for displaying information in various fields of application. The goal of this project is to design an fpga based controller for a system comprising of such apels.
 In this system, each pixel is modelled as three leds of the basic colors RGB, in which each led in a given row and column can be turned on independent of its two counterparts in the pixel.
This is a controller for displaying information on ADA fruits 32x16 LED matrix panel. The design interfaces with the NEXY'S A7100T Xilinx board. The system utilizes the Block Random Access Memory available on the board as a frame buffer to store data for each pixel.In a general sense, the controller accesses this storage for data and then goes through a sequence of checks before sending the data to the led panel.
The controller design consists of rtl modules in system verilog to describe its functionality. A c module that translates A string of characters into BRAM data, constraints and bitsream files have also been provided.is also provided.The design consists of two main parts. 
A sequencer and a pixel generator. The role of the sequencer is to control the proceedings of the control while the pixel generator is to generate values for each and every pixel.
