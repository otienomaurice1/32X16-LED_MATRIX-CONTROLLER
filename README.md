ADA fruit manufactures LED panels which can be used for displaying information in various fields of application. The goal of this project is to design an FPGA based controller for a system comprising of such Panels.
Each pixel is modelled as three LEDs of the basic colors RGB. Each LED belongs to a given row and column and can be turned on and off  independent of its two counterparts in the pixel.
This is a controller for displaying information on ADA fruits 32x16 LED matrix panel. The design interfaces with the NEXY'S A7100T Xilinx board. The system utilizes the Block Random Access Memory available on the board as a frame buffer to store data for each pixel.In a general sense, the controller accesses this storage for data and then goes through a sequence of checks before sending the data to the led panel.
The controller design consists of rtl modules in system verilog. BRAM data is either predetermined by running a character generator in C for the given string of characters to be displayed and loaded into the BRAM during synthesis or user determined at runtime by some external event e.g a button press to write into it.
